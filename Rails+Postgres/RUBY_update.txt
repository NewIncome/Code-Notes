Update with RBENV

1- list all the already installed ruby versions
  $ rbenv versions
2- list all the available versions for installation you have locally
  $ rbenv install -l
3- If the version you need is not visible, you need to get the Ruby 2.6.1 locally, to achieve this:
  $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/ && git pull
4- Now check -l again and install the required version, i.e.:
  $ rbenv install 3.0.0
5- setup that version to be the global ruby version of the system
  $ rbenv global 3.0.0
6- Now you have to rehash rbenv in order to install shims for all Ruby executables known to rbenv
  $ rbenv rehash
7- Finally, check the ruby version
  $ ruby -v

  
- Change a local version of ruby
  $ rbenv local 3.0.0

- List latest stable version
  $ rbenv install -l
- List all local versions
  $ rbenv install -L
