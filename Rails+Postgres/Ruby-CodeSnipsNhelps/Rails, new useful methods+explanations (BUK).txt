			New Methods, theory
 --------------------------------------------
-----DB:
  $ rails db:setup    # creates the db, loads the schema, and inits it with the seed
	$ rails db:migrate		# Creates/updates the DB & schema from the migration files
      # • runs db:schema:dump  ; in basic it just runs the 'change' or 'up' methods from the migrations
      # • if you specify a target version, Active Record will run the required migrations (change, up, down) until it has reached the specified version.
	$ rails db:rollback		# Creates the DB
	$ rails db:migrate:redo	# is the same as rolling-back then migrating

-----rails commands, when there's warnings from previous versions
  	$ RUBYOPT='-W:no-deprecated -W:no-experimental' rails ...
For backward compatibility with earlier versions of ruby prefix
  	$ RUBYOPT='-W0' rails ...


-----Console
  • Get all the tables in the DataBAse
	$ ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables 

-----Routes:
---on Resources:
＊ Member routing
  can be defined for actions that are performed on a member of the resource
	resource :posts do
	  post :archive, on: :member
	end
	# archive_post POST       /posts/:id/archive(.:format)

＊ Collection routing
  can be defined for actions that are performed on collection of the resource
	resource :posts do
	  get :search, on: :collection
	end
	# search_posts GET       /posts/search(.:format)

· We can also define multiple member / collection routes together
resource :posts do
  member do
    post :archive
    get :inactivate
  end

  collection do
    get :search
    post :upload
  end
end
