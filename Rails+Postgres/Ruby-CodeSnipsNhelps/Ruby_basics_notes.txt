•Mixins
 in Ruby are used to facilitate the support of multiple inheritance by allowing modules to access instance methods of another.
 (All the classes are modules, but not all modules are classes)
•Module
 is a collection of methods, constants, and class variables
•Variables
 ♦ Local: only accessible in the block of it's initialization; [a-z, _]
 ♦ Global: it's scope is global == it's accessible from anywhere in the program; [$]
 ♦ Instance: shared between mehtods of one instance; [@]
 ♦ Class: shared between instances of one class; [@@]
•Joins
 are used to combine data from 2 tables
 ♦ Left-join
    Combnines "all" records from L-table with "matching" records from the R-table
